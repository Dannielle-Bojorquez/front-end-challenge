					<h2>Happy Column 1</h2>
					<p>
						I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. You have to make these big decisions. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.

					<h2>Happy Column 2</h2>
					<p>
						Take your time. Speed will come later. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Water's like me. It's laaazy√Ç ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here.

					<h2>Happy little column 3</h2>
					<p>
						Happy painting, God bless. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.
